"Epicecom", an e-commerce website that featured distinct modes for men and women, dynamically changing the layout and options based on the selected mode. We developed the project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Additionally, we implemented an AI chatbot using Botpress, which recommended outfits for different occasions based on user preferences, enhancing the user experience with personalized suggestions.
